TDDD23
======

The game I'm developing for my TDDD23 - Design and Programming of Computer Games course.


Idea
----

The game is a spinoff from the old artillery type games where two players took turns aiming and shooting at eachother, only this game is set in space with planets and spaceships. Gravity will play a big role and weapons will be more powerful.
